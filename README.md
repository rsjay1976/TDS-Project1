Git hub users analysis repo

**How data was scrapped**
   
    1. Created a user token for using rest api in github 
    
    2. Used chatgpt to generate python code. 
    
    3. Used google collab to run python note book
    
    4. The only change which had to be done in python code was replacement of token
    
    5. Ran the program which generated the top 100 users in bangalore as csv
    
    6. Ran the second program which used the top100userscsv as input
    
    7. Both the output as well as the programs have been checked in to this repo.
